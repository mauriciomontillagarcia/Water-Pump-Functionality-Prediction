# Water-Pump-Functionality-Prediction
The project aims to improve water infrastructure maintenance by accurately predicting pump status. This helps optimize resource allocation, prioritize repairs, and reduce downtime. Governments, NGOs, and utility companies can use these insights to enhance water distribution, ensuring better access to clean water while minimizing operational costs.
